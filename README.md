Welcome to Soundstage, an application used to turn a sample into a looping atmospheric soundscape.

INSTRUCTIONS:

First, copy the path to a wav audio file into the text box for a file path.

Next, input how many frames you would like the starting and ending position of the loop to be randomized by. You can press the "Get Frames" button to see how many frames are in the audio clip you have input.

Next, input whatever percentage of the clip you would like to be the start point and the end point. (Ex. if you would like a clip to start from the halfway point enter "50")

Finally, press the start button and let the audio play for the next 10 seconds.
